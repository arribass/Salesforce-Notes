Universal Containers (UC) is using standard Service AI Grounding. UC created a custom rich text field to be used with Service AI Grounding.
What should UC consider when using standard Service AI Grounding?
- A. Service AI Grounding only works with Case and Knowledge objects.
- B. Service AI Grounding only supports String and Text Area type fields.
- C. Service AI Grounding visibility works m system mode.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Service AI Grounding retrieves data from Salesforce objects to ground AI-generated responses. Key considerations:
* Field Types: Standard Service AI Grounding supports String and Text Area fields. Custom rich text fields (e.g., RichTextArea) are not supported, making Option B correct.
* Objects: While Service AI Grounding primarily uses Case and Knowledge objects (Option A), the limitation here is the field type, not the object.
* Visibility: Service AI Grounding respects user permissions and sharing settings unless overridden (Option C is incorrect).

* Explicitly states support for "Text Area and String fields" only.
